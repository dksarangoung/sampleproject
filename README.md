# A Sample Project

This is a sample project. It will be removed sometime in the future, so
please do not rely on it for anything.

## What I intend to do here

This is my first Github repository, and I will play with things like:

1. Adding stuff to it
2. Writing documentation
3. Communicating with people
4. See what else I can do :smile:

Non-goals are:

* Insisting on correctness
* Speaking with _you_. I know you're a nice person. Now bug off.
* Doing anything that has any meaningful purpose.
  * But that may change in the future
* Pleasing **anybody**. I'm not your clown.

First of all, let's write a simple hello:

```go

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Github!")
}
```

What you say? Go not your thing? No problem!

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use 5.016.0;

say "Hello, World!";
```
